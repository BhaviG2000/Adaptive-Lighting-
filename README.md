# Adaptive-Lighting-
Adaptive LED's through Temperature and Sound


Themain goal that was anticipated with this project was to change the environment around them in areas where technology
is not as up to date, so the lights can brighten up and change the atmosphere around them. For example, in areas like
older homes and older vehicles, there is limited access to lighting and the type of lighting. With this project, the
consumer can have an environment to their liking. This allows the consumer to stay up to date with technology and
get a cool item to play with. The project uses both the temperature sensor and the microphone sensor to adapt to its
surrounding. The temperature sensor receives a temperature signal and according to the temperature the color of the
LED lights is changed. With the sound sensor, the signal
received allows the LEDs to flash according to the signal
received, so for instance when in a vehicle and the music is
turned up, the LEDâ€™s will flash according to the music. These two
sensors are then tied up with an LCD display that shows the
value received from both the temperature sensor and the sound
sensor
